_This is my first repo on cloud computing_

# CLOUD COMPUTING #
Cloud computing is a technology paradigm that enables individuals and organizations to access and use computing resources over the internet rather than relying on locally hosted infrastructure or physical hardware

HERE ARE SOME KEYWORDS OF CLOUD COMPUTING :-

* CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) is a computer architecture with a diverse and complex instruction set, often found in older processors, offering versatile yet potentially less efficient instruction execution

* RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) is a computer architecture with a simplified instruction set, focusing on efficient execution of basic instructions, commonly used in modern processors for high-speed computing

* RISC-V An open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) called RISC-V was created for a variety of computing systems. It is renowned for being straightforward, modular, and adaptable, making it a popular option for unique processing designs. The openness of RISC-V promotes creativity and teamwork in the processor sector

* IP ADDRESS An IP address, also known as an Internet Protocol address, is a special numerical designation given to each connected device to a computer network that makes use of the Internet Protocol. IP addresses have the following two main purposes:

1. Identification: Similar to how a street address identifies a real location, IP addresses are used to uniquely identify devices on a network. Devices can locate and communicate with one another online or inside a local network thanks to this identification.

2. Data packets are routed between devices in a network using IP addresses. IP addresses are used by routers and network switches to identify the destination of data and make sure it gets to the right person.

* There are two main versions of IP addresses in use today:
  
1.IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numeric addresses that are commonly expressed as four sets of decimal numbers, such as 192.168.1.1.

2.IPv6 addresses are 128-bit alphanumeric addresses that are frequently expressed in hexadecimal format (for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

* DNS Human-readable domain names are converted into IP addresses for use in internet communication by DNS (Domain Name System).

* KERNAL which controls memory, processes, and hardware and facilitates communication between software and hardware, serves as the brain of an operating system.
* The ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) standard specifies CPU commands, data types, and memory layout, which has an impact on computer hardware and software compatibility.
* PORT NUMBER A port number is a 16-bit numerical identifier in networking used to distinguish specific services or processes in computer communication.
* Debian is a free and open-source Linux distribution renowned for its dependability, extensive software library, and dedication to the principles of free software.
* BARE METAL In computing, the term "bare metal" refers to a physical server or computer that is running directly on hardware without the use of a hypervisor or virtualization layer.
* HYPER VISOR A hypervisor is a software or hardware layer that improves resource usage and scalability in virtualization and cloud environments by allowing many virtual operating systems to run on one physical server.
* VIRTUAL MACHINE A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based simulation of a real computer that enables many operating systems to run simultaneously on a single server for a variety of functions, including resource optimization and testing.
* FPGA  A reprogrammable integrated circuit with changeable logic blocks is called an FPGA, or field-programmable gate array, and it is used in a variety of applications to create custom digital circuits and accelerate hardware.
* SOCKETS - Using IP addresses and port numbers, sockets are network endpoints that enable data flow between applications or processes on different machines.
* The term "OSI" is frequently used to refer to the "Open Systems Interconnection" model, which is a theoretical framework for analyzing and standardizing the interactions between various networking protocols and communication systems.
* 7 LAYERS OF OSI :-
L7 - Application

L6 - Presentation

L5 - Cryptography

L4 - Port Number(16 Bits)

L3 - IP Address (32 Bits) : Router

L2 - Hardware Address - NIC, MAC Address(48 Bits) : Ethernet :SWITCH

L1 - Digital (1 and 0)

* MAC ADDRESS In order to ensure device identification and communication within Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, network interfaces are given a specific 48-bit hardware address called a MAC address (Media Access Control).

* A protocol is a set of guidelines that specify how data is sent through a network and received by other devices. Protocols guarantee standardized data transmission and communication. SMTP, HTTP, and TCP/IP are a few examples.
* CRYPTOGRAPHY The science of using arithmetic to secure data is known as cryptography. Data privacy and security are ensured in a variety of applications by encryption, which renders data unreadable, and decryption, which makes it readable again.
* VON NUMEAN The John von Neumann architecture, which has a single memory unit for both data and program instructions, makes sequential processing easier.
* Harvard architecture is a term used to describe a type of computer architecture in which the memory is physically divided into two independent units for instructions and data, enabling parallel access and accelerating computation.

* # OOPS CONCEPT #

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to design and implement software. It is based on several core concepts that promote modularity, reusability, and organization of code

# BLOCKCHAIN #

*Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that securely and openly logs transactions across numerous computers (called nodes).

*The term "blockchain" refers to a chain of blocks that are formed by grouping transactions into units called blocks and connecting them in chronological order.

* it was Developed by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto is credited with conceptualizing the first blockchain technology in 2008. In 2009, Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin blockchain and cryptocurrency.

# CRYPTOCURRENCY #

A decentralized digital or virtual currency, cryptocurrency is secured by cryptographic technology. It runs on a blockchain ledger, guaranteeing immutability and transparency. The original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, started a revolution that has resulted in the existence of hundreds of alternative coins (altcoins). Cryptocurrencies are used for a variety of things, including online commerce and investment, but their prices are notorious for being extremely volatile. Additionally, they are governed by globally changing regulatory systems.
